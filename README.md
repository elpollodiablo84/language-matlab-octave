# atom.io language-matlab-plus package

Atom.io language support for Matlab originally converted from TextMate Bundle: https://github.com/textmate/matlab.tmbundle.

Forked from https://github.com/thedavidprice/language-matlab-octave.
## Planned Features
- Code corrections and cleaning
- Better snippets
- Persistent variables highlighting like in the default MATLAB editor (I'll try, at least)
