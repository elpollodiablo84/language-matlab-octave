# atom.io language-matlab-plus package
Atom.io language support for Matlab originally converted from TextMate Bundle: https://github.com/textmate/matlab.tmbundle.

Forked from https://github.com/thedavidprice/language-matlab-octave.

## Features
- A lot of corrections and optimizations from the original conversion
- Code sections (%%) border

## Planned Features
- Persistent variables highlighting like in the default MATLAB editor (*I think it can be done*)
- Code sections (%%) folding (*I don't know if it's possible*)
